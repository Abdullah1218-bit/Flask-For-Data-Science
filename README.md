Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework written in Python.

It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

Flask is often referred to as a microframework because it provides the essentials for web development without unnecessary complexity.

It is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine.

The templates folder contains HTML files:

index.html: Linked with the /index route.

calculate.html: A form to input subject marks.

result.html: Displays the calculated average result.

test.json: A JSON file possibly used for testing or data reference.

This project demonstrates basic usage of Flask including:

Creating routes

Handling GET and POST requests

Working with forms

Rendering templates with Jinja2

Returning JSON responses from an API endpoint

To run the application:

Install Flask using pip install flask

Run the file app.py

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
